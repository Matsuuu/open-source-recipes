# Kimchi 김치

I like to make Mak kimchi (easy kimchi) during workweeks. It's tasty, tangy and easy to make.

## You'll need

### Ingredients

- 2 onions
- 1 apple
- 5 tablespoons of minced garlic
- 2 tablespoons of minced ginger
- 4 tablespoons of sugar
- Around 1 dl of fish sauce
- Quite a lot of gochugaru
- 1 whole Napa gabbage

## Preparing

### Gabbage

For the gabbage, wash it and slice into small pieces thorough. Add to a bowl with heavily salted water. You should salt the water with coarse salt. 

Grab some gloves. Trust me, you'll want some gloves for kimchi. Stir together the water and salt, and mix everything with the gabbage. Let the gabbage steep around in the heavily salted water for 8 to 16 hours. Until the gabbage's white parts are no longer snapping and breaking when bent.

### Sauce

For the sauce, you'll want to slice up and blend in a blender 2 onions and 1 apple. After making these into a smooth paste, cover your eyes. The onion will be sure to make you cry for the whole rest of the process. But trust me it'll be worth it.

Into the blended vegetables, mix together the rest of the ingredients, meaning:

- 5 tablespoons of minced garlic
- 2 tablespoons of minced ginger
- 4 tablespoons of sugar
- Around 1 dl of fish sauce
- Quite a lot of gochugaru

The amount of gochugaru will be according to your own taste. I tend to add until the paste is a good bright red color. I suggest you taste as you go. The spicyness will mellow out a little bit after fermentation.

After mixing the sauce together, throw it into the fridge.

## Putting it all together

After your gabbage has turned into this smooth and bendy form, drain away the water and heavily wash the gabbage to get rid of all of the excess salt. Then squeeze the excess moisture from the gabbage.

Throw the gabbages into the same bowl as the sauce, and mix all together **extremely thoroughly**. You'll want every single piece of gabbage to be coated with the sauce.

Next up, jam the finished product into a fermentation vessel. This can be a glass jar with a sealed lid, or anything you find to be fitting.

You want to leave a small airgap into the vessel for fermentation gases to be able to escape, but not too big of a bag for bad bacteria to get it. Alternatively, you can "burp" the container a few times a day.

Keep the vessels in room temperature for 3-6 days, tasting as you go. After you're happy with the result, move the jars into your fridge. At this point, you can drain the excess liquids from the kimchi if you want, to have a more crunchy, less saucy kimchi.

Enjoy in the next 2-3 months.
