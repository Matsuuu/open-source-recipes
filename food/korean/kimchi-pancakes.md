# Kimchi pancakes

Kimchi pancackes go with everything.

- Breakfast
- Lunch
- Dinner
- A late night snack
- Even more kimchi

They are also easy to make and keep well in the fridge for a couple of days

## Recipe

### Pancakes

Equal parts of

- Water
- Flour
- Kimchi (with some brine)

- A few eggs. 
    - This is to help with cooking the pancake. Usually I do 1 egg per 100g of ingredients or so.

- Gochugaru to taste
    - I usually sprinkle some onto the batter to give it some more color and a smooth kick.


### Dipping sauce

(Tablespoon is 15 grams)
(Teaspoon is 5-7 grams)

And what's a kimchi pancake without a dipping sauce?

- 1 Tablespoon of rice vinegar
- 1 Tablespoon of soy sauce
- half Teaspoon of sesame oil
- 1 Teaspoon of gochugaru (optional)
- 1 Teaspoon of toasted sesame seeds (optional)


## Putting it together

Cook the pancakes like any other pancake. I like to make big pancackes and split them into 4 parts.

Enjoy by dipping into the sauce, or by pouring the sauce onto the pancakes.

Enjoy hot or cold
