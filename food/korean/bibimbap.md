## Preparing

Bibimbap is a meal that is just a collection of multiple small parts. Combining all of these, and mashing them together will result in a healthy, fresh lunch to take with you to work.

Make the ingedients in order, as they will take different times to finish.

### Rice

Just throw your rice into a rice cooker. If you don't have one, you can use a kettle. But really. Rice cookers are cheap nowadays, get one.

### Onions

We're going to pickle the onions. Add to a jar, 2 thingly sliced (not diced) red onions, 1.25 dl of apple vinegar or mirin and 1.25 dl of water. Also add 15 grams of sugar and salt each.

Mix together and throw into the fridge in a sealed container. Let it sit there until use.

### Cucumbers

We'll make a small "cucumber kimchi".

Slice the cucumbers into thin slices. A mandoline is good for this.

Throw together the sliced cucumbers and coarse salt. Mix together with a glove (the salt can hurt your fingers). Let them sit for 15 minutes.

Meanwhile mix together the "kimchi" part of this. 

Mix together in a bowl:

- 1 tablespoon of gochugaru
- 1 teaspoon of mirin
- 1 teaspoon of sugar
- 1 teaspoon of minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon of sesame seeds
- Half an onion diced

Mix all together nicely. After the cucumber timer is up, rince thoroughly and get rid of all of the salt and extra moisture from the cucumbers. 

Mix cucumbers with the kimchi mix. Put in fridge to settle.

### Tofu

If you are a well managed person, marinate the tofu in your sauce of choice overnight. If not, split tofu into smaller layers and press between table cloths to remove excess moisture.

When preparing, fry the tofu with sesame oil and a sauce of choice. I like to throw together Gochujang, miring and sesame oil for an easy, tasty sauce.

### Avocado

Just split into small, beautiful slices

### Cilantro & Green onions

Cut into small pieces. Put aside for later (garnish).

### Carrots

Julienne your carrots into small slices. Throw into a hot skillet with a good amount of sesame oil and some green onions. Stir together, add to taste soy sauce, mirin and black pepper. Stir until glossy. Move to aside for later.

### Soy bean sprouts

Place soybean sprouts into a pot with water and some salt. Boil for 10-ish minutes.

After boil, drain and shock them with cold water to stop the cooking process.

Put together a sauce of garlic, gochugaru, green onions, sesame oil and sesame seeds. Fish sauce can be added if wanted.

Mix all together in a bowl and put aside.

### Gochujang sauce

Mix together

- 3 tablespoons of gochujang paste
- 1.5 tablespoons of mirin
- 1 tablespoon of sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon of maple syrup

You might want to make double amount of this. It's so tasty


### Assembly

On a bowl or a bento box, assemble a rice base. Then into 5-6 separate blocks on top of the rice, assemble your carrots, cucumbers, sprouts, tofu, avocado and such. Coat the whole dish with gochujang sauce.

### Enjoying

When eating this dish, you should mix **all** of the ingredients together. It used to look pretty but while you're eating it, you want every bite to contain all of the flavors and to achieve this, you need to really mix them all together hard. Trust me, you'll enjoy it more this way.
