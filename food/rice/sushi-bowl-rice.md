# General sushi-style rice

This is my go-to way to make rice whenever I make sushi, or meal prep any type of Tofu bowls for the week.

The added ingredients help keep the sushi soft a bit longer and makes it a LOT more refreshing.


## Ingredients

- 4 cups of rice (for me, 4 cups of rice makes around 1340 grams of cooked rice)
- 2 desiliters of Rice vinegar (or sushi vinegar or whatever they might call it where you are)
- A generous pinch of salt. I use himalayan rock salt
- A generous pinch of sugar. I usually just tilt the bag a little over the sauce cup
- A dash of oil

## Putting it together

As you might see, this isn't really a science. It's more so just important to not go sparing with the vinegar,
and to add some salt and sugar for taste. The oil just makes the rice a bit more smooth.

Mix this mixture in a cup thoroughly and as your rice comes out of a rice cooker (or pot), spread it evenly in a large
bowl or whatever you have lying around and pour this mixture on top of the rice. Mix thoroughly so all of the rice 
gets a dash of that *flavour*.

It might look a bit wet as you are pouring this into it, but trust me, the rice will absorb it in no time.
