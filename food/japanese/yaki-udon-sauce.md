# Yaki Udon sauce

I often crave for some good Yaki Udon (or soba, I'm not judging.)

When I don't have those premade sauce packets for them, this is the sauce I end up mixing most often.

## Recipe

(Tablespoon is 15 grams)
(Teaspoon is 5-7 grams)

- 2 tablespoons of soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons of oyster sauce
- 1 tablespoon of mirin (can sub with rice vinegar)
- 2 teaspoons of brown sugar
- half a teaspoon of rice vinegar (if you're subbing mirin, just skip this tbh)


## Putting it together

Cook the noodles, wash them thoroughly (i like less startchy), mix a little sesame oil in them, put aside.

Mix up the sauce, pour onto the noodles and enjoy.

You can also do a quick stir fry for the noodles with the sauce if you want.
